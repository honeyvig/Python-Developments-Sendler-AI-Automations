------
To fulfill the responsibilities and skills required for the Python Developer role you've described, you can start by creating Python scripts and practices in line with the following objectives. This solution assumes you're working on automating tasks related to Python development, including writing Python scripts for unit testing, database management, and version control automation.

Hereâ€™s an organized breakdown of how to approach this:
1. Type Hinting Using the typing Module

The typing module helps to enforce type safety in Python. Below is a basic example of using type hints in Python functions:

from typing import List, Dict

def get_user_data(user_id: int) -> Dict[str, str]:
    # Imagine this function fetches user data from a database.
    # The returned dictionary maps user details like "name" and "email".
    user_data = {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "johndoe@example.com"
    }
    return user_data

def get_all_users(user_ids: List[int]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    users = []
    for user_id in user_ids:
        users.append(get_user_data(user_id))
    return users

2. Unit Testing Using unittest

Unit testing ensures the quality and correctness of your Python code. Here's how you can write basic unit tests using the unittest library:

import unittest

class TestUserData(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_get_user_data(self):
        expected = {"name": "John Doe", "email": "johndoe@example.com"}
        actual = get_user_data(1)
        self.assertEqual(expected, actual)

    def test_get_all_users(self):
        user_ids = [1, 2, 3]
        result = get_all_users(user_ids)
        self.assertEqual(len(result), 3)  # Check if 3 users are returned.
        self.assertTrue(all("name" in user and "email" in user for user in result))  # Check for necessary keys.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

3. Database Interaction with SQLite

For the database interaction part, I'll provide an example using SQLite. You can expand this by connecting to more advanced databases like PostgreSQL.

import sqlite3

def create_table():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users
                 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, email TEXT)''')
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def insert_user(name: str, email: str):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)", (name, email))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def fetch_users() -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("SELECT id, name, email FROM users")
    users = c.fetchall()
    conn.close()
    return [{"id": user[0], "name": user[1], "email": user[2]} for user in users]

4. Version Control with Git

Automating version control processes requires interacting with Git via the command line or using libraries like GitPython.

# Initialize a git repository
git init

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push the changes to a remote repository
git push origin master

Alternatively, using the GitPython library to automate this:

import git

def git_commit_push(repo_dir: str, commit_message: str, branch_name: str):
    try:
        repo = git.Repo(repo_dir)
        repo.git.add(A=True)
        repo.index.commit(commit_message)
        origin = repo.remote(name='origin')
        origin.push(branch_name)
        print(f"Changes pushed to {branch_name}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

5. Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) in Python isn't as common as in other languages like Java, but you can implement it using injector or simply with constructor injection.

Here's an example using a simple DI approach:

from typing import Protocol

# Defining a database interface
class Database(Protocol):
    def save(self, data: str) -> bool:
        ...

class SQLiteDatabase:
    def save(self, data: str) -> bool:
        # Save data to the SQLite database
        print(f"Saving data: {data}")
        return True

class UserService:
    def __init__(self, db: Database):
        self.db = db

    def add_user(self, username: str, email: str):
        # Add user to DB
        self.db.save(f"User: {username}, Email: {email}")

# Using Dependency Injection
db = SQLiteDatabase()  # Create an instance of the SQLite DB
user_service = UserService(db)  # Inject the DB instance into UserService

user_service.add_user("John", "john@example.com")

6. Dockerization

To containerize your Python application, you can use Docker. Here's how you can write a Dockerfile for your app:

# Use Python 3.9 image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside the container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

To build and run your container:

docker build -t python-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 python-app

7. AWS Integration (EC2, SQS, CloudWatch)

For integrating with AWS services, such as EC2 instances, SQS for queues, and CloudWatch for logging, you would typically use the boto3 library.

Here's a simple example for interacting with SQS:

import boto3

# Initialize the SQS client
sqs = boto3.client('sqs', region_name='us-east-1')

def send_message_to_queue(queue_url: str, message_body: str):
    response = sqs.send_message(
        QueueUrl=queue_url,
        MessageBody=message_body
    )
    print(f"Message sent to queue: {response['MessageId']}")

8. CI/CD Automation

You can set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD to automate testing and deployment of your code.

Example GitHub Action to run Python tests on every push:

name: Python application

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest
